# Ego-Model

This repository contains selected code samples demonstrating my research on **self-supervised world model learning from egocentric video**, where agents learn **object-centric representations** and **temporal consistency** guided by **depth priors**.

## 🧠 Highlights
- Depth-aware proto-object discovery  
- Temporal consistency loss for object permanence  
- Egocentric video pretraining using Vision Transformers (ViT-S/16)
